## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

 * **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation Steps

1.  **Download the Code**
    Clone the repository or download the source code files to a folder on your computer.

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
    It's best practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Open your terminal or command prompt in the project folder and run:

    * **On macOS/Linux:**
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    * **On Windows:**
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

3.  **Install Required Libraries**
    The application requires `reportlab` for PDF generation and `tkcalendar` for the date picker widget. The script will alert you if they are missing, but you can install them manually.

    Install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install reportlab tkcalendar
    ```

## üöÄ How to Run

Once the setup is complete, run the application from your terminal with the following command (replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of the Python file):

```bash
python your_script_name.py
